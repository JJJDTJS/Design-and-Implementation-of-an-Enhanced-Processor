# **Design and Implementation of an Enhanced Processor**

## **Overview**

This project is part of **Lab 8** in our computer architecture course, where we are required to design and implement an **enhanced processor** in **Verilog**. The primary goal of this lab was to introduce new features such as an internal **program counter (PC)**, memory read/write capabilities, and additional arithmetic and logic instructions.

## **Processor Features**

### ðŸ”¹ **Instruction Execution & Control**

- The processor executes instructions stored in an external **16-bit wide, 256-word deep synchronous memory (SSRAM)**.
- The **instruction register (IR)** fetches and decodes instructions, while the **control finite state machine (FSM)** governs execution timing.

### ðŸ”¹ **Registers & Data Flow**

- **General-purpose registers**: r0r0 to r6r6.
- **Register r7r7 (Program Counter - PC)**: Automatically increments to fetch the next instruction.
- **ADDR & DOUT registers**: Handle memory read/write operations.

### ðŸ”¹ **Newly Implemented Instructions**

| **Instruction** | **Operation**                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ld rX, [rY]`   | Load value from memory at address stored in rY into rX. |
| `st rX, [rY]`   | Store value in rX into memory at address stored in rY.  |
| `and rX, Op2`   | Perform bitwise AND between rX and Op2.                 |
| `b{cond} Label` | Branch to `Label` if the condition is met.              |

### ðŸ”¹ **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Enhancements**

- Extended ALU capabilities to support **addition, subtraction, and bitwise AND operations**.
- Introduced **condition flags (C, N, Z)** to facilitate conditional branching.

**Key components:**

1. **Register File**: Includes general-purpose registers and the program counter.
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Supports `ADD`, `SUB`, and `AND` operations.
3. **Multiplexers**: Select between different data sources for execution.
4. **Control FSM**: Handles instruction execution sequencing.
5. **Memory Interface**: Allows interaction with external memory and peripherals.

## **Implementation Details**

### **ðŸ”¹ Program Counter (PC)**

- Implemented as an **internal counter (`r7`)**, replacing the external counter used in Lab 7.
- Automatically increments at each instruction cycle unless explicitly modified by a branch instruction.

### **ðŸ”¹ Memory Read/Write Mechanism**

- The **ADDR register** is used to send addresses to external memory.
- The **DOUT register** holds data for write operations.
- The **W signal** enables writing to memory.

### **ðŸ”¹ Instruction Fetch & Execution Timing**

| **Cycle** | **Operation**                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **T0**    | PC copied to ADDR, memory read initiated, PC increments.     |
| **T1**    | Wait for memory response.                                    |
| **T2**    | Instruction fetched into IR.                                 |
| **T3**    | Instruction execution begins (Register fetch, ALU ops, etc.). |
| **T4-T5** | Execution completion (Memory access, register updates, etc.). |

## **Testing & Simulation**

### **ðŸ”¹ ModelSim Verification**

- The **testbench** provided executes a sample program stored in `ModelSim` folder.
- The program reads switch values (`SW`) and displays them on LEDs.

### **ðŸ”¹ FPGA Implementation (DE1-SoC Board)**

- The design was synthesized in **Quartus Prime**.
- Physical testing was conducted using **hardware switches & LEDs**.
